# Emoji Math
https://mlsidd.github.io/Emoji-Math/

## Purpose
This project is intended to create a Math game in which the user must click the emoji pictures which are assigned a random number.  They click these images until the user can get "Your Number" to match the computer's "Target Number".  The random numbers assigned to the target number and to each emoji changes with each new game.
